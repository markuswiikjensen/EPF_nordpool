This is the repository for the code used in my Master thesis "Predicting the Norwegian Elspot Markets: Evaluation of Methods and Price-drivers".
In this repository are the Jupyter Notebooks used in the collection and preprocessing of data from three different sources (Nord Pool, Met, yahoo-finance), and in the training and evaluation of three different models (ARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM).
The data itself is not made publicly aviliable.
